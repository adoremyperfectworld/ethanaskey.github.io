        In coding, a "boilerplate" refers to a section of code that is
        repeatedly used in multiple places within a program with little to no
        variation, essentially pre-written code snippets that developers can
        reuse to quickly set up basic functionality without having to write the
        same code from scratch every time; it's like a standardized template
        that saves time and effort.
